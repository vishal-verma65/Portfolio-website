🌐 My Frontend Developer Portfolio
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, projects, and experience as a Frontend Developer. It is built using **Vite** for fast development and bundling, **GSAP** for smooth and modern animations, along with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

The design and development of this website have been done entirely by me. I thoroughly enjoyed the process of crafting both the UI and functionality. Throughout this project, I learned many new things that I’m confident will help me in my future work.
